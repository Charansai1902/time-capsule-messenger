⏳Time Capsule Messenger - Message the Future

In a world that’s moving faster than ever, I wanted to build something… slower. Something meaningful.  
So I built **Time Capsule Messenger**, a web app that lets you write a heartfelt message today and deliver it to yourself or someone else in the future.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

We often leave things unsaid — gratitude, encouragement, memories, or even love.  
There’s no emotional or secure way to send a message that arrives when it’s **truly needed — not now, but later.**  
Whether it's a note to your future self, a birthday wish years in advance, or a message to someone no longer around,  
**Time Capsule Messenger** gives your words… time travel.

## 🚀 What It Does

- ✍️ Write a personal message to yourself or someone else  
- 📅 Pick a **future delivery date**  
- 📬 Schedule it to be delivered at the right moment via **email**  
- 🔒 *(Coming soon)*: Video messages, personal dashboard, locking & privacy features

## 🛠 Tech Stack Used

| Layer      | Tools/Tech                            |
|------------|----------------------------------------|
| Frontend   | React.js + Tailwind CSS               |

| Hosting    | Vercel (Frontend) & Render (Backend)  |

## 🎨 UI Design

Built with a **minimal, nostalgic UI** to capture the emotion of writing to the future.  
Your words are securely stored and sent **exactly** when they’re meant to be read.

## 💡 Why I Built This

Because not every message needs to be “sent now.”  
Some are meant for later.  
Some are meant for healing.  
Some are just waiting for the **right moment**.
